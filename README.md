This is a project carried out as part of the course "Mobile Application Development" and was implemented by five students from the Department of Applied Informatics at the University of Macedonia.

The Recycling Reward Application is an app that awards users for recycling. In this app, multiple users can create accounts and will be rewarded by the app's reward system at regular intervals, as they log their recycling activities on their profiles. The app is supported by a database that stores all users with their personal information and the recycling data they have recorded during their activity in the app. The user account includes a personal profile, total rewards and points, a form for registering recyclable materials, as well as statistics of their recycling activities. The administrator has access to statistical data of all users, based on which they create rankings for the "top" users of the app.
